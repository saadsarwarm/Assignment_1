To extend this Kubernetes deployment for disaster recovery, I would architect the setup to span multiple availability zones (AZs) within the chosen cloud provider. Deploying the application across multiple AZs ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing pods and services so that if one AZ experiences an outage, the workload continues running in the others. This involves configuring the Kubernetes cluster nodes across AZs and using cloud provider-specific load balancers that can route traffic to healthy pods in any AZ. Additionally, persistent storage (if needed) should leverage multi-AZ storage solutions, such as AWS EBS with replication or Azure Managed Disks with zone redundancy, to prevent data loss.

For more comprehensive disaster recovery, I would consider a multi-region deployment. This involves provisioning Kubernetes clusters in two or more geographically separated regions and replicating application state and data between them, for example using cross-region database replication or storage sync services. Traffic management can be handled using global DNS load balancing services like AWS Route 53 or Azure Traffic Manager to route users to the nearest healthy region. In case of a regional failure, failover to the secondary region would ensure business continuity with minimal downtime. Automating synchronization and failover with infrastructure-as-code tools and CI/CD pipelines would also be critical to maintain consistency and rapid recovery.
